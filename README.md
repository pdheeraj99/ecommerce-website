# Project Feature

- Fetching Products using API\*\* 🌎
  - Implement a robust API integration in your React application to fetch products from an external source, such as an e-commerce website or a custom backend.
  - Consider using `axios` or the `fetch` API to handle HTTP requests and retrieve product data in various formats, like JSON or XML.
- Redux for State Management\*\* 👩🏻‍💻
  - Set up Redux, a powerful state management library, to centralize and manage application state efficiently.
  - Define reducers and actions to handle the state changes related to products, cart items, and any other application data.
  - Connect React components to the Redux store using the `connect` function or hooks like `useSelector` and `useDispatch` for seamless state management.
- Add and Remove Functionality in Cart\*\* 🛒
  - Create a shopping cart feature that allows users to add and remove products from their cart.
  - Implement actions and reducers specifically for the cart, ensuring it updates in real-time as users interact with it.
  - Consider handling quantity adjustments, subtotal calculations, and any additional features like discounts or promotions.
- React Class-Based Components\*\* 🏛️
  - Utilize class-based components in your React application for specific scenarios where class components are required or preferred, such as using lifecycle methods.
  - Showcase your understanding of class components by managing component state, handling side effects, and implementing class-specific methods like `render()`, `componentDidMount()`, etc.
  - Compare and contrast class components with functional components, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in different situations.
